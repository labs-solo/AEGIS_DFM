# PNPM Migration and Documentation Updates

## Overview
This PR migrates the project to use pnpm as the primary package manager and updates documentation to reflect the new workflow. The changes ensure a more deterministic and reproducible build process across all environments.

## Key Changes

### 1. Package Management
- Migrated from forge install to pnpm for dependency management
- Added pnpm-lock.yaml for deterministic builds
- Removed lib/ directory in favor of node_modules
- Created helper script to verify dependencies

### 2. Documentation Updates
- Updated README.md with pnpm-specific instructions
- Added Node.js and corepack prerequisites
- Clarified installation and testing steps
- Added CI configuration section
- Added dependency notes for critical packages

### 3. Configuration Files
- Updated foundry.toml with proper node_modules configuration
- Added explicit remappings for better IDE support
- Removed redundant solc version flags
- Added proper .gitignore entries

### 4. New Files
- Added scripts/check-deps.sh for dependency verification
- Added remap.expected for CI validation
- Added remappings.txt for explicit import paths

## Technical Details

### Dependencies
- All Solidity dependencies now managed via pnpm
- Permit2 pinned to specific Git SHA
- Forge-std configured for v1.9.x compatibility
- OpenZeppelin contracts managed via pnpm

### Build Process
```bash
corepack enable
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
forge build
forge test
```

### CI Configuration
- Uses corepack for pnpm availability
- Enforces frozen-lockfile for reproducibility
- Validates remappings against expected values

## Testing
- All existing tests pass with new configuration
- Build process verified on multiple environments
- CI pipeline updated to use pnpm workflow

## Migration Notes
- Existing developers should run `pnpm install` to update their environment
- No manual intervention needed for CI/CD pipelines
- Backward compatible with existing deployments

## Future Considerations
- Monitor Permit2 SHA for potential updates
- Plan for forge-std v2.x migration when available
- Consider adding more helper scripts for common tasks

### Target: Combined score of 9.5+ out of 10

## üîÑ Code Changes in This PR

### 1. Hook Optimization
- Removed redundant hook implementations:
  - `_beforeDonate` and `_afterDonate` hooks removed
  - Streamlined hook flags by removing `BEFORE_INITIALIZE_FLAG`, `BEFORE_ADD_LIQUIDITY_FLAG`, and `BEFORE_REMOVE_LIQUIDITY_FLAG`
- Extracted common logic into `_processRemoveLiquidityFees` for better maintainability
- Standardized hook implementation patterns across test infrastructure

### 2. Improved Oracle Implementation
- Renamed variables for better clarity (`lastFallbackTicks` ‚Üí `oracleTicks`)
- Modified oracle deployment order in tests to prevent circular dependencies
- Removed redundant dynamic fee manager references (`activeDynamicFeeManager`)
- Enhanced oracle initialization sequence in test setup

### 3. New Utility Libraries
- Added `SolvencyUtils.sol`: A comprehensive library with functions for:
  - Calculating Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios for positions
  - Validating vault solvency against configurable thresholds
  - Computing debt values with interest accrual
  - Providing complex solvency checks for different scenarios

- Added `TransferUtils.sol`: A robust token transfer management system:
  - Seamless handling of both ERC20 and native ETH transfers
  - Proper validation and error handling for ETH transfers
  - Gas-efficient token transfer operations
  - Fallback mechanisms for failed ETH transfers

### 4. Test Infrastructure Enhancements
- Improved LP share calculation tests with:
  - Better debugging through detailed logging
  - More precise mathematical validations
  - Enhanced handling of edge cases
  - Comprehensive round-trip testing
- Reorganized test structure for better readability
- Updated initialization sequence in test base classes
- Added helper functions for retrieving pool state

### 5. Bug Fixes and Security Improvements
- Fixed potential issues in hook permission configuration
- Corrected deployment sequence to prevent state inconsistencies
- Improved error handling in fee processing
- Enhanced validation in token transfers
- Better tracking and handling of protocol fees

## üìù Action Items for @taylor
Daily benchmarking task:
- Create a new PR with another benchmark assessment on a daily basis
- Track and document improvements across all categories
- Continue until the combined score reaches 9.5+ out of 10

### Focus Areas (Priority Order)
1. Documentation
2. Security Vulnerability Mitigation
3. Contract Interaction Simplification
4. Code Quality Refinement
5. Further Gas Optimization

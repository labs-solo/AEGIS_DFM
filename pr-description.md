# DynamicFeeManager Refactor & Test Improvements

This PR contains a series of improvements to the DynamicFeeManager module, focusing on code quality, test coverage, and gas optimization.

## Test Fixes & Improvements

- Fixed reentrancy test in LM mock to properly propagate `ReentrancyLocked()` revert
- Added comprehensive unit tests for DynamicFeeManager (>95% coverage)
- Fixed oracle observation tests
- Improved test helper gas efficiency by using `.call` instead of `.transfer`

## Code Quality & Gas Optimizations

- Migrated to Locker-based reentrancy guard
- Made `DynamicFeeManager.initialize()` idempotent
- Removed unused oracle overload
- Added `BASE_FEE_FACTOR_PPM` constant
- Optimized gas usage with unchecked math
- Made hook references immutable
- Disabled unused `afterRemoveLiquidity` hook permissions

## Architecture Improvements

- Replaced `pokeReinvest` with `claimPendingFees`
- Standardized error handling with `CustomRevert`
- Utilized transient storage for better efficiency
- Removed redundant checks in `TruncGeoOracleMulti`

## Event & Error Handling

- Fixed duplicate event declarations
- Added `CapToggled` event
- Added custom errors for better gas efficiency

## Testing

All tests pass, including:
- Unit tests for `Spot.sol`
- Comprehensive DynamicFeeManager tests
- Oracle observation tests

## Impact

These changes improve:
- Code quality through better architecture and standardization
- Gas efficiency via optimized storage and execution paths
- Test coverage with comprehensive unit tests
- Error handling with custom errors and proper propagation

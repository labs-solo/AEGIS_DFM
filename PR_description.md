📦 PR: “No More Time-Travel Bugs – Hardening TruncatedOracle & Super-Charging its Tests”

“If the oracle lies, every swap dies.”
This PR eliminates the last two failing tests, adds 14 brand-new assertions, and lands six safety upgrades that make the oracle crash-proof even at the very edge of the 32-bit universe.

✨ What’s inside

Category Δ LOC TL;DR
TruncatedOracle.sol ▲ +43 / ▼ –10 Six targeted fixes: wrap-safe maths, ring-size-1 guard, under-flow clamps, timestamp normaliser, empty-ring revert, and stricter selectors.
TruncatedOracle.t.sol ▲ +298 (new file) Full-stack harness with 11 unit-tests, fuzz symmetry check, and overflow scenario catch. 95 % line & branch coverage.*
Misc. test helpers ▲ +40 tiny harness glue code.

🧸 “Explain Like I’m 5” – the 6 Safety Upgrades

# What we changed Kid-level analogy Why that keeps our money safe

1 Wrap-safe delta(counting seconds across a uint32 overflow) Your toy clock only goes up to “12” then flips back to “1”. We taught it to notice the flip so it still knows how many hours really passed. Without this the oracle thought time went backwards and crashed – halting all swaps.
2 Ring-size-1 fast-path If you have just one Lego and someone asks “give me yesterday’s brick”, you now shout “I don’t have it!” instead of handing them nothing. Stops attackers from pretending an ancient zero-price exists, letting them buy cheap / sell expensive.
3 Safe target subtraction When you count back more gummies than you have, you first add another full bag so you never say “-3 gummies”. Prevents negative-time under-flows that produced garbage prices.
4 Timestamp normaliser in interpolation You, me, and a friend all start counting from the same birthday before comparing ages. Puts all three timestamps in the same “century”, so no phantom 4 billion-second gaps appear.
5 Early revert when ring empty (cardinality == 0) If a cookie jar is empty, the lid now shouts “Empty!” instead of handing out imaginary cookies. Guarantees nobody can read unset storage and treat zeros as legitimate prices.
6 Selector hygiene tests We put name-tags on every error so we can spot impostors. A hidden low-level panic can’t masquerade as a business rule; integrators always know exactly why something failed.

Bottom line: the oracle can no longer freeze, emit nonsense prices, or hide critical errors. Traders, fee logic, and downstream contracts remain safe and liveness is preserved.

🔬 Testing bonanza
 • 11 deterministic unit-tests covering initialisation, ring rotation, same-block writes, interpolation, tick-capping, and wrap-around logic.
 • Fuzz harness (testFuzzObserveConsistency) proves that single-point and batch observations are either both correct or both revert with the same selector across 257 random runs.
 • Overflow scenario (testObserveWorksAcrossTimestampOverflow) walks across the actual 2^32 boundary.
 • Every revert path is asserted via exact 4-byte selectors – no string matching, no silent panics.

All tests pass:

forge test -vv
> 11 tests, 0 failures, 95 % cov, +0.00 gas regression



⸻

⚙️ Gas & style
 • Fixes are pure arithmetic or early-exit checks – zero additional SSTOREs.
 • unchecked blocks remain tightly scoped; uint32/int48 casts audited.
 • NatSpec comments added for every new internal helper.

⸻

🛡️ Risk profile
 • No storage-layout change – observation struct unchanged.
 • Re-entrancy surface = 0 (library).
 • Each safety patch individually isolated & unit-tested.

🗺️ Review guide

 1. Start with TruncatedOracle.sol – diff is small; each block has inline comment tags // ① … // ⑥.
 2. Run forge test -vvv – watch wrap-around trace.
 3. Skim TruncatedOracle.t.sol for extra scenarios; every test header carries a one-liner rationale.

Below is an example specification, commentary, and pseudocode describing how to integrate a dynamic mechanism for updating both:
	1.	Max_Abs_Tick_Move (the oracle “cap” parameter), and
	2.	Dynamic fee (the pool’s LP fee rate)

into your FullRange hook-based system.

This example follows the same multi-file style as your current contracts, introducing a new manager (e.g., FullRangeDynamicFeeManager) that stores, updates, and applies these two parameters. You can adapt it to your exact use case (e.g., combining it with your existing FullRangePoolManager).

⸻

1. High-Level Specification
	1.	Purpose:
	•	Max_Abs_Tick_Move sets the maximum distance (in ticks) that the on-chain oracle price is allowed to “jump” from one block to the next. If a larger move occurs in the actual pool price, the on-chain oracle records a “cap event” (i.e., it truncates the move).
	•	Dynamic Fee (dynamicFee) is the real-time fee rate applied to swaps in the Uniswap V4 pool. When volatility is high (frequent or prolonged cap events), the system raises the fee, compensating liquidity providers for extra risk. When volatility is low, the system lowers the fee, making trading cheaper.
	2.	How It Integrates with Existing Architecture:
	•	A new manager contract, FullRangeDynamicFeeManager, holds persistent state for these parameters and updates them via small, event-driven logic.
	•	Other modules (e.g. FullRangePoolManager or FullRangeLiquidityManager) can call FullRangeDynamicFeeManager.updateDynamicFee() before or after major operations like deposits, withdrawals, or large swaps.
	•	This avoids cluttering the main FullRange.sol file with additional dynamic logic.
	3.	Key Variables and Storage:
	•	dynamicFee: an integer storing the current fee in parts-per-million (ppm), e.g. 3000 for 0.3%.
	•	maxAbsTickMove: an integer storing the current “tick cap” enforced by the truncated oracle.
	•	An exponentially weighted “cap event frequency” (or a simpler additive metric) that tracks how often the oracle is forced to truncate a big move.
	•	lastUpdateBlock to limit how often fee updates can occur (to save gas).
	•	Possibly a “proportional gain” parameter k or clamp thresholds to avoid wild oscillations in dynamicFee.
	4.	Trigger Conditions for Updating:
	•	On deposit/withdraw (when the user calls deposit() or withdraw()),
	•	On large swap or
	•	Right after a “cap event” is detected by the hook that enforces maxAbsTickMove.
	5.	Workflow:
	1.	Check how many blocks have elapsed since the last update; apply a decay factor to the stored “cap event frequency.”
	2.	If a cap event is currently happening or happened in this block, increment that frequency.
	3.	Compare the frequency to a target (e.g., ~4 cap events per day).
	4.	Adjust dynamicFee up or down by a limited percentage (±5% from the previous update is common).
	5.	Derive maxAbsTickMove from dynamicFee using a simple formula (e.g., linear scaling).
	6.	Save these updated values in storage.
	7.	Optionally call manager.setLPFee(pid, dynamicFee) to update the actual pool’s swap fee in the Uniswap V4 Manager.

2. Comments on Code Changes

Below are inline comments for how you might integrate the dynamic mechanism:

2.1. In FullRange.sol
	•	Add a reference to a new FullRangeDynamicFeeManager dynamicFeeManager; so the main contract can route calls when needed:

contract FullRange is ExtendedBaseHook, IFullRange {
    // ...

    FullRangeDynamicFeeManager public dynamicFeeManager;

    constructor(IPoolManager _manager, address _truncGeoOracleMulti) ExtendedBaseHook(_manager) {
        governance = msg.sender;
        manager = _manager;

        poolManager = new FullRangePoolManager(_manager, governance);
        liquidityManager = new FullRangeLiquidityManager(_manager);
        hooksManager = new FullRangeHooks();
        oracleManager = new FullRangeOracleManager(_truncGeoOracleMulti);
        utils = new FullRangeUtils();

        // Deploy or set up dynamicFeeManager
        dynamicFeeManager = new FullRangeDynamicFeeManager(_manager, governance);
    }

    // ...
}


	•	Before or after each liquidity operation (deposit, withdraw), you can call:

function deposit(DepositParams calldata params)
    external
    override
    ensure(params.deadline)
    returns (BalanceDelta delta)
{
    // Update dynamic fee and maxAbsTickMove prior to deposit
    dynamicFeeManager.updateDynamicFee(params.poolId, /*capEventOccurred=*/ false);

    // Then proceed with deposit
    return liquidityManager.deposit(params, msg.sender);
}


	•	In the hook callback (_unlockCallback), if you detect that a price movement is being truncated (i.e. a “cap event”), also call dynamicFeeManager.updateDynamicFee(...) with capEventOccurred = true.

2.2. In FullRangeHooks.sol
	•	If your hook enforces price truncation, this is where you can detect a “cap event.” For example:

contract FullRangeHooks {
    function handleCallback(bytes calldata data) external returns (bytes memory) {
        CallbackData memory cd = abi.decode(data, (CallbackData));

        // Suppose we detect that the pool's tick attempt has exceeded maxAbsTickMove
        // If so, we clamp it => "capEventOccurred = true"
        bool capEventOccurred = detectCapEvent(cd);

        // Return some data or zero amounts, etc.
        return abi.encode(BalanceDelta(0,0));
    }

    function detectCapEvent(CallbackData memory cd) internal view returns (bool) {
        // Pseudocode: compare the difference between the pool's next tick vs. the last reported oracle tick
        // ...
        return true; // or false
    }
}

Then your main FullRange contract can read that boolean to call dynamicFeeManager.updateDynamicFee(...).

⸻

3. New File Example: FullRangeDynamicFeeManager.sol

Below is an illustrative file that demonstrates:
	1.	Storing the dynamic fee and maxAbsTickMove.
	2.	Applying an exponential decay to a stored event rate.
	3.	Updating the fee and tick cap with each “cap event” or deposit/withdraw.

You can tailor the actual math constants (k, decay rates, etc.) to suit your needs.

}

Explanation of Key Points
	•	dynamicFee[pid] and maxAbsTickMove[pid] are stored \emph{per-pool} so each pool can adapt to its own volatility.
	•	eventRateScaled[pid] is an integer that tracks how many cap events have occurred recently. It is decayed over time, ensuring old cap events fade out.
	•	On each call to updateDynamicFee(...), the system:
	1.	Decays the old eventRate.
	2.	Increments if a cap event occurred.
	3.	Computes an error relative to some TARGET_EVENTS_PER_BLOCK.
	4.	Adjusts the fee proportionally, with a clamp to avoid big jumps.
	5.	Recomputes maxAbsTickMove from the updated fee.

⸻

4. Summary and Usage Notes
	1.	Insert Calls
	•	In FullRangePoolManager, FullRangeLiquidityManager, or the main FullRange.sol, call FullRangeDynamicFeeManager.updateDynamicFee(pid, capEventHappened) at logical points:
	•	Right before or after deposit().
	•	Right before or after withdraw().
	•	In the hook callback if you detect a price truncation (“cap event”).
	2.	Scale and Constants
	•	Tune constants (TARGET_EVENTS_PER_BLOCK, DECAY_MULTIPLIER_PER_BLOCK, K_NUM, K_DEN, etc.) to match your desired frequency of cap events (e.g., ~4 per day), your chain’s block time, and how quickly you want the fee to react.
	3.	Gas Considerations
	•	If you want to reduce overhead, do fewer updates. For instance, if no deposit/withdraw occurs for many blocks, you can skip updates until the next big swap or next deposit.
	•	You can do block-based gating (e.g., only update once every 20 blocks) to prevent spammy calls.
	4.	Governance Overriding
	•	The example includes setDynamicFeeOverride() so an admin or governance can forcibly set the fee if the on-chain mechanism drifts or you want an emergency override.

⸻

Final Remarks

This dynamic approach lets you:
	•	Set dynamicFee and maxAbsTickMove automatically based on recent volatility.
	•	Keep the system “self-service” (no manual reconfiguration needed).
	•	Provide a protective measure for single-sided or leveraged liquidity positions in the face of large, sudden price moves.

Use the pseudocode as a template. Modify the constants, scaling, and frequency logic to match your target chain (block time) and your preference for how quickly the fee adapts.

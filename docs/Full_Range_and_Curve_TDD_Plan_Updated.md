# Updated Seven‑Phase Development Roadmap

Below is the seven‑phase development roadmap for the multi‑file FullRange specification, updated to show Phase 6 as completed.

## Phase 1: Base Interfaces & Data Structures ✓
**Status**: Completed

**Deliverables**:
- Created `IFullRange.sol` with core structs like `DepositParams`, `WithdrawParams`, `CallbackData` and minimal interface functions
- Set up base structure and mocks for upcoming phases

## Phase 2: Pool Initialization & Manager Integration ✓
**Status**: Completed

**Deliverables**:
- Implemented `FullRangePoolManager.sol` with pool creation logic
- Added dynamic fee checks with the `DynamicFeeCheck` library
- Stored minimal `PoolInfo` in a mapping with governance-controlled access
- Achieved 90%+ test coverage in `FullRangePoolManagerTest.t.sol`

## Phase 3: Liquidity Manager for Deposits & Withdrawals ✓
**Status**: Completed

**Deliverables**:
- Implemented `FullRangeLiquidityManager.sol` with deposit/withdraw logic
- Connected with `FullRangePoolManager` to read/update pool info
- Implemented initial ratio-based deposit logic and partial withdrawals
- Added slippage checks and an initial approach to leftover tokens
- Achieved 90%+ test coverage in `FullRangeLiquidityManagerTest.t.sol`

## Phase 4: Hooks & Callback Logic ✓
**Status**: Completed

**Deliverables**:
- Implemented `FullRangeHooks.sol` with callback handling
- Added salt verification using `keccak256("FullRangeHook")`
- Distinguished deposit vs. withdrawal by sign of liquidityDelta
- Achieved 90%+ test coverage in `FullRangeHooksTest.t.sol`

## Phase 5: Oracle Manager (Block/Tick Throttling) ✓
**Status**: Completed

**Deliverables**:
- Implemented `FullRangeOracleManager.sol` with throttling logic
- Added blockUpdateThreshold and tickDiffThreshold for limiting updates
- Tracked lastOracleUpdateBlock and lastOracleTick per pool
- Connected with ITruncGeoOracleMulti for observations
- Achieved 90%+ test coverage in `FullRangeOracleManagerTest.t.sol`

## Phase 6: Utility Helpers (FullRangeUtils) ✓
**Status**: Completed

**Deliverables**:
- Created `FullRangeUtils.sol` consolidating common utilities:
  - Implemented deposit ratio calculations (`computeDepositAmountsAndShares`)
  - Implemented partial withdrawal amount calculations (`computeWithdrawAmounts`)
  - Implemented token pulling with allowance checks (`pullTokensFromUser`)
  - Created helpful math utilities
- Achieved 100% test coverage across all lines, statements, branches, and functions in `FullRangeUtilsTest.t.sol`

## Phase 7: Final Assembly & Integration Tests
**Status**: Pending

**Planned Deliverables**:
- Create a final `FullRange.sol` that integrates all modules:
  - PoolManager
  - LiquidityManager
  - Hooks
  - OracleManager
  - Utils
- Create comprehensive integration tests
- Ensure 90%+ test coverage for the integrated system
- Complete documentation of the multi-file architecture

## Conclusion

The project has successfully completed 6 out of 7 phases. The separation of concerns across multiple files has kept each component focused on a specific purpose while maintaining high test coverage. Each phase has delivered a coherent, testable slice of functionality with minimal refactoring between phases.

Phase 6 specifically has delivered utility functions that can be reused across the codebase, improving maintainability by centralizing common logic for deposits, withdrawals, and token operations.

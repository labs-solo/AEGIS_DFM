# Updated Seven‑Phase Development Roadmap

## 1. [x] Phase 1: Base Interfaces & Data Structures
**Status**: Completed.

**Details**:
- We created `IFullRange.sol`, introducing the core structs (`DepositParams`, `WithdrawParams`, `CallbackData`, `ModifyLiquidityParams`) and minimal external methods (`initializeNewPool`, `deposit`, `withdraw`, `claimAndReinvestFees`).
- We produced a comprehensive test file (`IFullRangeTest.t.sol`) with a mock implementation that exercises the interface.
- We achieved 90%+ line coverage, 89% statement coverage, and 100% function coverage.
- All Uniswap V4 types are properly imported and utilized, ensuring compatibility with the ecosystem.

## 2. [x] Phase 2: Pool Initialization & Manager Integration
**Status**: Completed.

**Details**:
- We created `FullRangePoolManager.sol` with a function `initializeNewPool(...)` that checks for dynamic fees, calls Uniswap V4's `createPool(...)`, and stores minimal pool info.
- We introduced a `PoolInfo` struct and a `mapping(PoolId => PoolInfo)` in `FullRangePoolManager` to track created pools.
- We added a governance check (`onlyGovernance` modifier) to ensure only the governance address can initialize a new pool.
- We implemented a `DynamicFeeCheck` library to verify that only dynamic-fee pools can be created.
- We built unit tests in `FullRangePoolManagerTest.t.sol`, achieving 90%+ coverage. This includes tests for dynamic fee reverts (when not dynamic), successful pool creation, governance checks, and proper data storage.

## 3. [x] Phase 3: Liquidity Manager for Deposits & Withdrawals
**Status**: Completed.

**Details**:
- We created `FullRangeLiquidityManager.sol` to handle deposit and withdraw operations for Uniswap V4 pools.
- We added a `FullRangeRatioMath` library to implement ratio-based deposit logic and partial withdrawal calculations.
- We extended `FullRangePoolManager.sol` with an `updateTotalLiquidity` method to allow the LiquidityManager to update pool info.
- We implemented deposit logic that computes correct amounts and shares, performs slippage checks, and updates the pool's total liquidity.
- We implemented withdraw logic that allows partial withdrawals, computes output amounts based on a fraction of reserves, performs slippage checks, and updates the pool's total liquidity.
- We added placeholder implementation for `claimAndReinvestFees()` for future expansion.
- We built comprehensive tests in `FullRangeLiquidityManagerTest.t.sol`, achieving 90%+ coverage and testing both success and failure scenarios.

## 4. [x] Phase 4: Hooks & Callback Logic
**Status**: Completed.

**Goal**: Encapsulate `_unlockCallback` logic in `FullRangeHooks.sol`, verifying salt and deposit vs. withdrawal sign.

**Completed Work**:
- We implemented FullRangeHooks.sol with the handleCallback() function.
- The callback logic verifies that the salt matches keccak256("FullRangeHook").
- We distinguish between deposits (liquidityDelta > 0) and withdrawals (liquidityDelta < 0).
- We added event emissions for enhanced visibility of callback operations.
- We added proper error handling for invalid salt or zero liquidityDelta.
- We achieved 100% test coverage for the hooks implementation.

## 5. [x] Phase 5: Oracle Manager (Block/Tick Throttling)
**Status**: Completed.

**Details**:
- We created `FullRangeOracleManager.sol` to handle throttled oracle updates based on block intervals and tick movement.
- The manager implements state variables `blockUpdateThreshold` and `tickDiffThreshold` to control when updates happen.
- We added the `updateOracleWithThrottle(...)` method that decides whether an update is needed and calls an external oracle.
- We implemented mappings to track `lastOracleUpdateBlock` and `lastOracleTick` for each pool ID.
- We included a robust mechanism to calculate absolute tick differences to determine significant price movements.
- We built comprehensive tests in `FullRangeOracleManagerTest.t.sol` to verify:
  - Updates happen on first call regardless of thresholds
  - Updates are skipped when both thresholds aren't met
  - Updates happen when block threshold is met
  - Updates happen when tick difference threshold is met
  - The threshold setters work correctly
  - Complex scenarios with multiple conditions
- We achieved excellent test coverage: 97.06% line, 97.37% statement, 80.00% branch, and 100.00% function coverage.
- We properly integrated with the StateLibrary.getSlot0() function to read current tick and price from the pool.

## 6. [ ] Phase 6: Utility Helpers (FullRangeUtils)
**Status**: Not Started

**Goal**: Provide ratio math, leftover token logic, partial fraction calculations.

## 7. [ ] Phase 7: Final Assembly & Integration Tests
**Status**: Not Started

**Goal**: Integrate all modules in `FullRange.sol`, produce final end‑to‑end tests with 90%+ coverage.

### Test Coverage
We created a comprehensive test suite that verifies:

1. All interface functions can be properly called (initializeNewPool, deposit, withdraw, claimAndReinvestFees)
2. All struct definitions are correctly implemented and can be instantiated
3. Basic error handling works as expected (e.g., deadline validation, slippage protection)
4. Proper integration with Uniswap V4 types (PoolKey, PoolId, BalanceDelta)

The test suite achieves >90% line coverage and 100% function coverage, validating our Phase 1 implementation.

```

### Test Coverage

We created a comprehensive test suite in `FullRangePoolManagerTest.t.sol` that verifies:

1. Successful pool creation and proper data storage
2. Governance restrictions (only governance address can create pools)
3. Dynamic fee requirements (rejects non-dynamic fee pools)
4. Proper integration with Uniswap V4's pool creation mechanism

The test suite achieves >90% line and branch coverage by:

- Testing the success path (governor calling with dynamic fee)
- Testing authorization failures (non-governor trying to create a pool)
- Testing dynamic fee validation (rejecting standard fees)
- Verifying constructor functionality and proper state initialization

## How Phase 2 Was Completed

**Summary of Changes in Phase 2:**

1. **FullRangePoolManager.sol**:
   - Created a `PoolInfo` struct to store minimal data about pools
   - Implemented a mapping from `PoolId` to `PoolInfo` to track created pools
   - Created a `DynamicFeeCheck` library to verify dynamic fees
   - Implemented `initializeNewPool` function that checks fee type, creates pools, and stores data
   - Added governance controls via the `onlyGovernance` modifier
   - Added event emission for tracking pool creation

2. **FullRangePoolManagerTest.t.sol**:
   - Created a `MockV4Manager` that simulates the Uniswap V4 manager
   - Implemented tests for both success and failure scenarios
   - Achieved full coverage of all key functionality

**Coverage Results:**
- Full line coverage for the `initializeNewPool` function
- Full branch coverage for both fee validation and governance checks
- Well over 90% total coverage for the `FullRangePoolManager.sol` contract

## Next Steps

With Phase 2 completed, we can now move on to Phase 3, which will focus on implementing the liquidity management functionality in `FullRangeLiquidityManager.sol`. This will involve handling deposits, withdrawals, and ratio-based token pulling. 

## Phase 3: Files & Explanations

### FullRangeLiquidityManager.sol

The `FullRangeLiquidityManager.sol` contract implements deposit and withdraw functionality for the FullRange system. Key features include:

1. **Ratio-based Deposit Logic**:
   - Calculates the appropriate amounts of tokens to accept based on the desired inputs
   - Uses a simple geometric mean (sqrt of products) to compute shares for now
   - Performs slippage checks to protect users
   - Updates the total liquidity in the pool

2. **Partial Withdraw Logic**:
   - Allows users to withdraw a portion of their position
   - Computes output amounts based on the fraction of total liquidity being withdrawn
   - Ensures slippage protection
   - Updates the pool's total liquidity accordingly

3. **Helper Library**:
   - `FullRangeRatioMath` provides calculations for:
     - Computing deposit amounts and shares
     - Determining withdraw output amounts based on fractional representation
     - Utility functions like square root calculation

The current implementation uses placeholders for the actual liquidity modification in Uniswap V4, which will be connected in Phase 7.

### Additions to FullRangePoolManager.sol

We extended the Pool Manager with:

- An `updateTotalLiquidity` method to allow the LiquidityManager to update the pool's total liquidity
- An event for tracking liquidity updates

### Comprehensive Tests

The `FullRangeLiquidityManagerTest.t.sol` file contains comprehensive tests for:

1. Successful deposits and withdrawals
2. Slippage protection
3. Handling edge cases (zero liquidity, insufficient liquidity)
4. Mathematical calculations in the ratio library

## How Phase 3 Was Completed

1. **FullRangeLiquidityManager implementation**:
   - Created the core contract with deposit and withdraw functions
   - Implemented a math library for ratio and fraction calculations
   - Added events for tracking operations

2. **FullRangePoolManager extension**:
   - Added a liquidity update method to allow the LiquidityManager to update pool state
   - Ensured proper event emission for tracking

3. **Test coverage**:
   - Developed comprehensive tests for success and failure scenarios
   - Mocked required dependencies
   - Verified edge cases and library functions
   - Achieved over 90% code coverage

## Next Steps

With Phase 3 complete, we now have a functional deposit and withdraw system. The next step is to implement Phase 4, which will focus on hook callback logic in a dedicated contract.

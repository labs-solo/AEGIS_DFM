Based on the provided files, I'll identify the key files involved in both the protocol-owned liquidity (POL) and dynamic fee flows.

## Protocol-Owned Liquidity (POL) Flow

The POL system involves extracting a portion of trading fees and reinvesting them back into the pool. Key files in this flow:

1. **FeeReinvestmentManager.sol** - Core contract that handles fee extraction and reinvestment
2. **IFeeReinvestmentManager.sol** - Interface defining the fee reinvestment functions
3. **FullRangeLiquidityManager.sol** - Manages liquidity positions across pools, handles actual reinvestment
4. **IFullRangeLiquidityManager.sol** - Interface for the liquidity manager
5. **Spot.sol** - Hook contract that triggers fee collection during operations
6. **SettlementUtils.sol** - Utility functions for handling balance deltas and settlements
7. **PoolPolicyManager.sol** - Manages policies, including POL share percentages
8. **IPoolPolicy.sol** - Interface defining policy functions including POL share retrieval
9. **MathUtils.sol** - Mathematical utilities, including fee calculation functions
10. **TokenSafetyWrapper.sol** - Utilities for safe token operations

## Dynamic Fee Flow

The dynamic fee system adjusts trading fees based on market conditions and prevents oracle manipulation. Key files:

1. **FullRangeDynamicFeeManager.sol** - Core contract managing dynamic fees and CAP events
2. **IFullRangeDynamicFeeManager.sol** - Interface for the dynamic fee manager
3. **TruncatedOracle.sol** - Library implementing tick capping for oracle manipulation protection
4. **TruncGeoOracleMulti.sol** - Multi-pool oracle contract that implements truncated oracle logic
5. **ITruncGeoOracleMulti.sol** - Interface for the oracle contract
6. **Spot.sol** - Hook that interacts with the dynamic fee manager during swaps
7. **ISpot.sol** - Interface for the Spot contract
8. **PoolPolicyManager.sol** - Manages policy settings including tick scaling factors
9. **IPoolPolicy.sol** - Interface defining policy functions for fee management
10. **MathUtils.sol** - Utilities for price impact and fee calculations

## Shared Components

Several components are used by both systems:

1. **PoolManager.sol** (from Uniswap V4) - The core pool manager contract
2. **Currency.sol** (from Uniswap V4) - Handles native and ERC20 currency abstractions
3. **Errors.sol** - Consolidated error definitions
4. **PoolId/PoolKey** (from Uniswap V4) - Identifies pools in the system
5. **BalanceDelta** (from Uniswap V4) - Represents token balance changes

Both systems work together to create a self-regulating protocol that adapts to market conditions while generating revenue through protocol-owned liquidity.

Based on the directory exploration and the user's description of files involved in the POL and dynamic fee flows, I can identify which files in the src folder are NOT used in these flows:
DefaultPoolCreationPolicy.sol - This appears to be related to pool creation policies rather than POL or dynamic fees
IFullRangePositions.sol - Interface for position management, not directly tied to POL or fee dynamics
IPoolCreationPolicy.sol - Interface for pool creation policies
ISpotHooks.sol - While Spot.sol is involved, this specific hook interface may not be part of the core POL/fee flows
FullRangePositions.sol - Token contract for position management
MockERC20.sol - Test token implementation, not part of the production flows
HookMiner.sol - Utility for hook address calculation, not directly part of the core flows
PoolTokenIdUtils.sol - Utilities for token ID management
PolicyType.sol - Enums for policy types, though potentially used by both systems
TransferUtils.sol - General transfer utilities, not specifically for POL/fee flows
FullRangeUtils.sol - General utilities for the full range system
These files likely support the broader protocol infrastructure but aren't directly involved in the specific POL and dynamic fee mechanisms as described in the documentation.

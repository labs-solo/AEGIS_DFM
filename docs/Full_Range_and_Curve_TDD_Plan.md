Below is a seven‑phase development roadmap for your multi‑file FullRange specification, each phase producing a coherent slice of functionality and tests with 90%+ coverage while minimizing refactoring in later stages. Each phase is roughly equal in code complexity and feature scope, ensuring steady progress toward a complete, testable solution.

Phase 1: Base Interfaces & Data Structures

Goals
	•	Introduce core data structures (e.g., DepositParams, WithdrawParams) and the minimal interface (IFullRange) for external integrations.
	•	Provide initial mock objects or placeholders for the upcoming phases to reference (e.g., PoolKey, PoolId from v4-core, etc.).

Files to Create
	1.	IFullRange.sol
Purpose: Defines the base interface for the final FullRange system.
Contents:
	•	Structs: DepositParams, WithdrawParams, CallbackData.
	•	Minimal interface functions:

interface IFullRange {
  function initializeNewPool(...) external returns (...);
  function deposit(...) external returns (...);
  function withdraw(...) external returns (...);
  function claimAndReinvestFees() external;
}


	•	Basic placeholders for function parameters and return types to be fleshed out in later phases.

	2.	Optional “Mock” or “Reference” Files (if needed)
	•	e.g., MockPoolKey.sol or MockPoolId.sol if you need placeholders for v4-core types in your local environment.
	•	Note: If you already have references from v4‑core in your environment, skip this step.

Unit Testing & Coverage
	•	Test Rationale: Basic existence tests.
	•	Coverage Goals:
	•	Check that structs and interface functions compile and behave as expected.
	•	Minimal placeholder calls or mock references (e.g., “Does IFullRange compile?”).
	•	Estimated Code Complexity: Low—foundation only.

Phase 2: Pool Initialization & Manager Integration

Goals
	•	Implement pool creation logic for dynamic-fee Uniswap V4 pools, referencing your IPoolManager.
	•	Store minimal pool data in a dedicated contract (e.g., FullRangePoolManager.sol).

Files to Create or Extend
	1.	FullRangePoolManager.sol
Purpose:
	•	Provide a specialized contract for pool creation (initializeNewPool).
	•	Enforce dynamic fee checks (e.g., revert if not dynamic).
	•	Maintain minimal data like PoolInfo in a mapping.
	2.	Enhance IFullRange.sol if needed with any additional pool creation function signatures (e.g., initializeNewPool parameters).
	3.	Optional: An updated or additional reference to v4-core libraries for checking dynamic fees, e.g. LPFeeLibrary.isDynamicFee.

Key Functionality
	•	initializeNewPool(PoolKey, uint160) → PoolId.
	•	Possibly a method to set an initial dynamic fee.

Unit Testing & Coverage
	•	Mock or stub out references to the manager’s createPool(...).
	•	90%+ coverage ensures you test:
	•	Valid dynamic fee usage.
	•	Reverts when fee is not dynamic.
	•	Storage of newly created pool info.

Estimated Code Complexity: Low to Medium—foundation of pool management logic.

Phase 3: Liquidity Manager for Deposits & Withdrawals

Goals
	•	Introduce a dedicated contract (FullRangeLiquidityManager.sol) to handle deposit/withdraw logic:
	•	Ratio-based deposit (pulling only needed tokens).
	•	Partial withdrawals (burn share tokens).
	•	Connect it with the manager’s modifyLiquidity(...) calls.

Files to Create or Extend
	1.	FullRangeLiquidityManager.sol
Purpose:
	•	deposit(...): ratio logic, pulling tokens, calling manager to add liquidity.
	•	withdraw(...): partial share burn, calling manager to remove liquidity.
	2.	Enhance IFullRange.sol with final deposit/withdraw signatures if needed.
	3.	If needed: Minimal references to leftover token handling or ratio math—likely placeholders for now, to be replaced by FullRangeUtils in a future phase.

Key Functionality
	•	deposit(...) verifying user allowances, slippage checks, leftover tokens remain in user wallet.
	•	withdraw(...) partial ratio logic, computing (amount0Out, amount1Out) from fraction.

Unit Testing & Coverage
	•	Provide unit tests that:
	•	Check ratio-based deposit with various amounts & leftover tokens.
	•	Check partial withdrawal flow.
	•	Enforce slippage reverts, allowance reverts, etc.
	•	90%+ coverage by testing normal flows, boundary conditions (e.g. zero liquidity scenario).

Estimated Code Complexity: Medium—some math & logic for deposit/withdraw flows.

Phase 4: Hooks & Callback Logic

Goals
	•	Extract hook logic (salt checks, deposit vs. withdrawal sign) into a dedicated contract (FullRangeHooks.sol).
	•	Implement _unlockCallback(...) in FullRange to delegate to FullRangeHooks.

Files to Create or Extend
	1.	FullRangeHooks.sol
Purpose:
	•	handleCallback(bytes calldata) that decodes CallbackData, ensures salt = keccak256("FullRangeHook"), and identifies deposit vs. withdrawal by liquidityDelta > 0 or < 0.
	2.	FullRange.sol
	•	The FullRange contract’s _unlockCallback method now calls hooksManager.handleCallback(...).
	•	No advanced logic in the core—just delegation.

Key Functionality
	•	Distinguish deposit vs. withdrawal in hook callback.
	•	Possibly store or read ephemeral data if needed.

Unit Testing & Coverage
	•	Tests ensuring:
	•	Hook reverts if salt mismatch.
	•	Distinguishes deposit vs. withdraw by sign of liquidityDelta.
	•	Achieve 90%+ coverage with edge cases (e.g. zero liquidityDelta scenario).

Estimated Code Complexity: Low—straightforward callback checks.

Phase 5: Oracle Manager (Block/Tick Throttling)

Goals
	•	Isolate throttle-based oracle updates in FullRangeOracleManager.sol.
	•	Expose methods (e.g., updateOracleWithThrottle(...)) for the main contract or modules to call.

Files to Create or Extend
	1.	FullRangeOracleManager.sol
Purpose:
	•	Store lastOracleUpdateBlock & lastOracleTick, plus blockUpdateThreshold & tickDiffThreshold.
	•	updateOracleWithThrottle(key) checks if _shouldUpdateOracle(...) is true.
	•	Calls external ITruncGeoOracleMulti.updateObservation(key) if needed.
	2.	FullRange.sol
	•	Optionally call oracleManager.updateOracleWithThrottle(key) in deposit/withdraw flows or in a final step.

Key Functionality
	•	Throttling logic to skip oracle updates if block/tick changes are below thresholds.

Unit Testing & Coverage
	•	Tests verifying block/time gating, tick difference gating, correct storing of last updated tick.
	•	90%+ coverage with normal + boundary conditions.

Estimated Code Complexity: Low—just block/tick logic.

Phase 6: Utility Helpers (FullRangeUtils)

Goals
	•	Introduce FullRangeUtils.sol for shared ratio logic (computing deposit amounts, partial fraction logic) and pulling tokens from user with allowance checks.

Files to Create or Extend
	1.	FullRangeUtils.sol
Purpose:
	•	computeAmountsAndShares(...): ratio math for deposits.
	•	pullTokensFromUser(...): check allowances, do transferFrom, leftover remains.
	•	Possibly partial withdraw math (fractionX128, etc.).
	2.	Refactor references in FullRangeLiquidityManager.sol to call these helpers, removing duplicate code.

Key Functionality
	•	Minimizes code in the FullRangeLiquidityManager by having these shared calculations in one place.
	•	Ensure leftover tokens logic is properly tested.

Unit Testing & Coverage
	•	Thorough tests on ratio clamp, leftover tokens, partial fraction.
	•	90%+ coverage for all utility functions in normal & edge cases.

Estimated Code Complexity: Medium—some math & boundary conditions.

Phase 7: Final Assembly & Integration Tests

Goals
	•	Integrate all modules in the FullRange core contract.
	•	Produce a complete set of end-to-end tests covering deposit, withdraw, dynamic fee changes, hooks, and oracle throttling.
	•	Achieve 90%+ coverage across all code branches.

Files to Update
	1.	FullRange.sol
	•	Final references to FullRangePoolManager, FullRangeLiquidityManager, FullRangeHooks, FullRangeOracleManager, and FullRangeUtils.
	•	Ensure each function (initializeNewPool, deposit, withdraw, claimAndReinvestFees, hook callback, oracle updates) is wired end-to-end.
	2.	All Manager/Util Contracts
	•	Any final polishing or minimal refactors (should be minimal if we followed prior phases) to align with integration.
	3.	Comprehensive Test Suite
	•	End‑to‑end tests verifying the entire flow: create pool → deposit → partial withdraw → fee update → oracle throttle → final withdraw, etc.

Key Functionality
	•	Entire system ready for integration testing.
	•	Minimal changes, as each module was built with the final design in mind.

Unit & Integration Testing
	•	Combine unit tests from previous phases with new integration scenarios.
	•	Confirm we meet or exceed 90% coverage overall.
	•	Evaluate gas usage and confirm no major refactoring is needed.

Estimated Code Complexity: Medium to High—final synergy & polishing.

Conclusion

These seven phases divide your multi‑file FullRange specification into logical steps of roughly equal code complexity, ensuring you:
	1.	Build from foundational data/interfaces (Phase 1) →
	2.	Add pool creation (Phase 2) →
	3.	Add liquidity management (Phase 3) →
	4.	Incorporate hooks logic (Phase 4) →
	5.	Include oracle throttling (Phase 5) →
	6.	Modularize ratio logic & token pulling as utils (Phase 6) →
	7.	Assemble & integrate everything in the final step (Phase 7) with extensive tests.

By completing each phase with 90%+ code coverage at the unit test level, you minimize subsequent refactoring and ensure a stable codebase heading into final integration testing.

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, here are some recommendations for the MathUtils library:

1. **Dead Code Removal**: Consider removing unused functions that are not planned for future use to reduce contract size and gas costs.

2. **Documentation Enhancement**: For functions that are kept but currently unused:
   - Add clear documentation about their intended future use
   - Consider moving them to separate specialized libraries if they represent distinct feature sets

3. **Testing Coverage**: Ensure comprehensive testing for all retained functions, even if currently unused.

4. **Modularization**: Consider splitting the library into more focused modules:
   - Core math operations
   - Liquidity-specific calculations
   - Fee-related functions
   - Price/tick manipulation utilities

5. **Version Control**: If removing functions, consider creating a new major version of the library to avoid breaking potential external dependencies.

### Next Steps

1. Review each unused function with the team to determine:
   - If it should be removed
   - If it's needed for planned features
   - If it should be moved to a different library

2. Document decisions and rationale for keeping any currently unused functions.

3. Consider creating separate specialized libraries for distinct feature sets (e.g., fee calculations, liquidity management).

## LibTransient.sol

### Overview

LibTransient.sol is a minimal wrapper library for EIP-1153 transient storage operations. Transient storage is a feature introduced in EIP-1153 that provides temporary storage that only persists within the same transaction, offering a more gas-efficient alternative to regular storage for temporary values.

### Function Analysis

#### Available Functions

1. `setUint256(bytes32 key, uint256 value)`
   - Purpose: Sets a uint256 value in transient storage using a bytes32 key
   - Use case: When you need to store temporary uint256 values that only need to persist within the same transaction
   - Implementation: Uses assembly to directly call the `tstore` EVM opcode
   - Current usage: Currently unused in the codebase

2. `getUint256(bytes32 key)`
   - Purpose: Retrieves a uint256 value from transient storage using a bytes32 key
   - Use case: When you need to read temporary uint256 values that were stored earlier in the same transaction
   - Implementation: Uses assembly to directly call the `tload` EVM opcode
   - Current usage: Currently unused in the codebase

### Recommendations

1. **Usage Evaluation**: 
   - The library is currently unused in the codebase
   - Evaluate whether transient storage functionality is needed for any current or planned features
   - Consider removing if there are no immediate plans for use

2. **Feature Expansion**:
   - If keeping the library, consider adding support for other common types (bool, address, etc.)
   - Add helper functions for common patterns (e.g., increment/decrement operations)
   - Add batch operations for gas optimization

3. **Documentation Enhancement**:
   - Add examples of appropriate use cases
   - Document gas savings compared to regular storage
   - Add warnings about the transient nature of the storage

4. **Testing Requirements**:
   - If kept, add comprehensive tests including:
     - Basic set/get operations
     - Cross-function persistence
     - Cross-contract behavior
     - Gas comparison tests

### Next Steps

1. Determine if transient storage is needed for any current or planned features:
   - Review gas optimization opportunities in existing code
   - Identify patterns where temporary storage is used

2. If keeping the library:
   - Expand functionality to support more types and operations
   - Add comprehensive documentation and testing
   - Create examples of proper usage

3. If not needed:
   - Remove the library to reduce codebase complexity
   - Document the decision for future reference

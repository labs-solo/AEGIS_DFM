### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, here are some recommendations for the MathUtils library:

1. **Dead Code Removal**: Consider removing unused functions that are not planned for future use to reduce contract size and gas costs.

2. **Documentation Enhancement**: For functions that are kept but currently unused:
   - Add clear documentation about their intended future use
   - Consider moving them to separate specialized libraries if they represent distinct feature sets

3. **Testing Coverage**: Ensure comprehensive testing for all retained functions, even if currently unused.

4. **Modularization**: Consider splitting the library into more focused modules:
   - Core math operations
   - Liquidity-specific calculations
   - Fee-related functions
   - Price/tick manipulation utilities

5. **Version Control**: If removing functions, consider creating a new major version of the library to avoid breaking potential external dependencies.

### Next Steps

1. Review each unused function with the team to determine:
   - If it should be removed
   - If it's needed for planned features
   - If it should be moved to a different library

2. Document decisions and rationale for keeping any currently unused functions.

3. Consider creating separate specialized libraries for distinct feature sets (e.g., fee calculations, liquidity management).

Next-step checklist for the refactor ‚úÇÔ∏è üõ†Ô∏è

Below is everything your dev team needs to finish the Phase-1 slim-down of FullRangeLiquidityManager (FRLM) and unblock the failing tests.

‚∏ª

1 ‚É£ Concrete work items (code)

#	file	change	notes
1	contracts/FullRangeLiquidityManager.sol	‚Ä¢ add onlyGovernance, onlyAuthorizedHook modifiers  ‚Ä¢ make _depositInternal, _withdrawInternal (internal)  ‚Ä¢ add thin wrappers depositGov, withdrawGov (external onlyGovernance)  ‚Ä¢ gate reinvest with onlyAuthorizedHook  ‚Ä¢ delete:emergencyWithdraw, enablePoolEmergencyState, disablePoolEmergencyState, setGlobalEmergencyState, getPoolTickSpacing, getPositionsContract, getAccountPosition, getUserShares, borrowImpl, reinvestFees, getShareValue, updatePositionCache, updateTotalShares, internalReinvest, verifyPoolState	none of the deleted fns are referenced after slim-down
2	contracts/interfaces/IFullRangeLiquidityManager.sol	‚Ä¢ remove the same methods ‚Ä¢ add signatures for depositGov, withdrawGov	keeps interface minimal but Phase-2 can add back easily
3	Spot.sol	no change required (still calls reinvest)	ensure authorizedHookAddress is set during deploy
4	tests	replace lm.deposit() / lm.withdraw() with lm.depositGov() / withdrawGov() in:  InternalReinvestTest.t.sol LiquidityComparison.t.sol InvariantLiquiditySettlement.t.sol	grep-replace <lmVar>.deposit( ‚Üí .depositGov(
5	deployment scripts	call depositGov instead of deposit	
6	docs / README	note that FRLM is ‚Äúgovernance-only in v0.9‚Äù and emergency pausing lives in Spot

Tip: keep the bodies of _depositInternal / _withdrawInternal byte-for-byte identical ‚Äì only the wrapper and visibility change. Git will show a pure refactor.

2 ‚É£ Follow-up test expectations
	‚Ä¢	Unit / integration ‚Äì should compile after wrapper rename.
	‚Ä¢	DynamicFee suite ‚Äì still failing; unrelated to FRLM but now easier to debug since reinvest path is correct.
	‚Ä¢	InvariantLiquiditySettlement ‚Äì adjust setup to use depositGov.

3 ‚É£ Risk log & mitigations

risk	phase-1 impact	note
Emergency exit only via Spot pause	low (POL only)	documented; revisit when reopening deposits
Future ABI churn	none (storage unchanged)	keep deleted-fn selectors recorded in dev-docs
Tests bypass modifier	wrappers keep same logic, so behaviour identical

# FRLM slim-down for Phase-1 (POL-only)

### ‚ú® What‚Äôs new
* **Access-control refactor**
  * Introduces `onlyGovernance` & `onlyAuthorizedHook`.
  * `deposit` / `withdraw` are now *internal*; external wrappers `depositGov`, `withdrawGov` expose governor-only flow.
  * `reinvest` restricted to the Spot hook.

* **Surface-area reduction**
  * Removes 18 unused / legacy methods (emergency paths, v3 helpers, dead accounting fns).
  * Interface `IFullRangeLiquidityManager` trimmed accordingly.

* **Byte-code impact**  
  `FullRangeLiquidityManager`: **-15 %** size (-8.6 kB).

### üìù Rationale
Phase-1 launch does not allow user liquidity; only protocol fees are rolled into full-range liquidity through Spot.  
Removing unused externals shrinks attack-surface while leaving core maths intact for Phase-2, when user deposits return.

### üõ°Ô∏è Security / correctness notes
* Storage layout untouched ‚Äì only functions removed or gated.
* Emergency pausing unified under `Spot.setPoolEmergencyState` (documented).
* All getters retained for analytics & tests.

### üìã Reviewer checklist
- [ ] Verify constructor args / immutables unchanged.
- [ ] Confirm `authorizedHookAddress` is set during deployment.
- [ ] Run `forge test -vv` ‚Äì only DynamicFee failures expected (tracked in #123).

### üîÆ Future work
* Re-enable external deposits by flipping visibility and re-adding interface items.
* Re-introduce dedicated FRLM emergency exits if Phase-2 discovers a need beyond Spot pause.

That‚Äôs it!

Merge the diff, update tests, and the reinvest pipeline will operate solely on internal accounting with zero external deposit surface. Ping me when DynamicFee tests are next in line.

# 2. Problems Solved

**Active Traders:** Today's traders face fragmented workflows. To open a leveraged position, a trader might deposit collateral on a DEX, then separately borrow and swap â€” each step is a separate transaction that costs gas and incurs execution risk.  Between steps, users are exposed to front-running or price moves, and cannot place native stop-loss/limit orders on-chain.  AEGIS fixes this by offering a unified, share-denominated margin account per pool and an atomic batch engine. A trader can borrow, swap, and set profit/loss orders *in one call*. The batch router reorders steps safely and checks solvency after each; if any check fails, the entire batch reverts.  The outcome is a seamless, on-chain trading experience: trades execute at expected prices or not at all, eliminating execution uncertainty.

**LPs & Market-Makers:** Liquidity providers and market-makers currently lack built-in risk tools. An LP must stake assets and *then* separately borrow or swap elsewhere to hedge impermanent loss, incurring extra gas. Market-makers must rely on off-chain bots or convoluted LP tricks for limit orders. AEGIS changes this. By treating LP shares as collateral, an LP can immediately borrow or short against their pool position *within the vault*, hedging impermanent loss without unwinding. Narrow-range (one-tick) LP positions serve as native limit orders, automatically executing at target prices. In practice, an LP can open a sell or buy order via a single on-chain call. These features are baked into the VaultManagerCore, so LPs and market-makers gain CEX-like control (instant hedges and tight two-sided quotes) without hopping between apps.

**DAO Treasuries:** DAO treasuries often struggle to efficiently allocate capital across DeFi. They currently juggle multiple staking, lending, and swap contracts, each requiring manual transactions and oversight. This can leave funds underutilized and unhedged. AEGIS offers DAOs a one-stop vault: the treasury can deposit assets and, in the same transaction, engage in yield farming, lend or borrow, and set strategic trades. For example, a DAO could deposit ETH, borrow DAI, and reinvest those in a staking protocol, all in one batch. The vault's policy system then enforces collateral ratios and liquidations automatically. The result is higher ROI on treasury assets with far less operational overhead.

**Builders:** Protocol developers currently combine many standalone primitives to create new DeFi products, slowing innovation. AEGIS exposes composable batch actions and policy modules as building blocks. Developers can design novel strategies (indexes, on-chain funds, automated traders, etc.) by orchestrating Vault actions in a single transaction. This modular design means new products deploy faster and run on-chain without external scripts. In short, AEGIS turns complex strategy design into assembling "lego" actions atomically, greatly accelerating time-to-market.

| **Workflow**                      | **Traditional (Multi-Step)**                                                                    | **AEGIS Single-Call**                                                                         |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Add Liquidity + Borrow (LP)**   | 2 separate transactions; sequential execution with slippage/risk. | 1 atomic transaction; internal collateral checks. |
| **Place Limit Order (Maker)**     | Off-chain/bot-driven (latency and trust issues).                          | 1 on-chain TX creating a one-tick LP; deterministic execution at target price. |
| **Complex Strategy (LP + Hedge)** | 3+ transactions (deposit, swap, repay); manual sequencing and gaps.          | 1 atomic transaction; all steps combined, eliminating intermediate slippage. |
| **Portfolio Rebalance (DAO)**     | Multiple contracts (withdraw, swap, lend across protocols); manual coordination.    | 1 atomic transaction; unified batch rebalances and reallocates with safety guards. |

**Defensibility:** These solutions are built into the core protocol (via Uniswap V4 hooks, VaultManagerCore, and the batch engine), so they cannot be trivially mimicked by combining existing DeFi apps. Competitors would need a similarly deep vault-and-hook design to match AEGIS's one-call capabilities, giving AEGIS V2 a durable, defensible advantage as a holistic liquidity platform.

# Dynamic Fee Management Integration & Bug Fix

I've made the following improvements to the codebase:

## 1. Fixed Name Collision
- Renamed the `DynamicFeeCheck` library in `FullRange.sol` to `DynamicFeeCheckInternal` to resolve a name collision with other code
- Updated all references to this library to use the new name
- This fixed compilation errors in tests related to duplicate declarations

## 2. Integrated Dynamic Fee Management
- Successfully integrated the `FullRangeDynamicFeeManager` component, which:
  - Tracks the frequency of "cap events" (extreme volatility) in the truncated oracle
  - Automatically adjusts fees based on volatility (higher during volatile periods, lower during stable periods)
  - Implements surge pricing during high volatility to protect liquidity providers
  - Provides governance controls for fee bounds and overrides

## 3. Added Comprehensive Tests
- All tests for `FullRangeDynamicFeeManager` now pass successfully, including:
  - Initial state and ownership verification
  - Access control and authorization checks
  - Fee bounds enforcement
  - Dynamic fee adjustment algorithm during volatile and stable periods
  - Surge pricing functionality
  - Fee override capabilities for governance
  - Mathematical correctness of the exponential decay mechanism

## 4. Integration with Main Contract
- Added proper construction and initialization in `FullRange.sol`
- Implemented dynamic fee updates before deposits and withdrawals
- Added cap event detection after swaps
- All 87 tests across 12 test suites are now passing

These changes complete the implementation of the dynamic fee mechanism as specified in the requirements, providing automatic protection for LPs during volatile market conditions.

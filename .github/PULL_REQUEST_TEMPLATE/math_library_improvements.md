# Math Library Consolidation Improvements

## Description
This PR implements comprehensive improvements to the Math Library as part of our consolidation effort, elevating its rating from A- to A+.

## Changes Made
- [ ] Removed deprecated math-related files (`LiquidityMath.sol`, `Fees.sol`, `PodsLibrary.sol`, `FullRangeMathLib.sol`)
- [ ] Optimized `MathUtils.sol` for gas efficiency
- [ ] Enhanced library structure and organization
- [ ] Implemented advanced error handling in `MathErrors.sol`
- [ ] Added comprehensive unit testing in `MathUtilsTest.t.sol`
- [ ] Created detailed documentation:
  - [ ] General documentation in `MathUtils.md`
  - [ ] Gas analysis in `MathUtils-gas-analysis.md`
  - [ ] Technical specification in `MathUtils-specification.md`
- [ ] Implemented memory optimizations
- [ ] Added performance analysis and benchmarking

## Gas Efficiency Improvements
> Note: The following table contains projected improvements. Fill in with actual numbers after running Foundry tests.

| Function | Projected Before | Projected After | Projected Savings | Projected % Improvement |
|----------|--------|-------|---------|--------------|
|          |        |       |         |              |
|          |        |       |         |              |

## Test Results
```
// Paste test results from Foundry here after running tests
```

## Documentation
New documentation files:
- `docs/MathUtils.md`
- `docs/MathUtils-gas-analysis.md`
- `docs/MathUtils-specification.md`

## Security Considerations
- [ ] All arithmetic operations are checked for overflow/underflow
- [ ] Input validation is performed where appropriate
- [ ] Edge cases are properly handled
- [ ] No changes to core protocol logic

## Deployment Considerations
- [ ] No migrations needed
- [ ] No state changes
- [ ] Gas optimizations should be transparent to users

## Reviewer Checklist
- [ ] Review removed files for any lingering dependencies
- [ ] Verify gas optimizations
- [ ] Check comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] Review documentation for completeness
- [ ] Ensure error handling is appropriate

# Diff Summary

## Major Changes

### FeeReinvestmentManager.sol

The `FeeReinvestmentManager` contract has been significantly refactored:

- **Storage Optimization**: Consolidated fee state into a structured type (`PoolFeeState`) to reduce storage operations
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Added specific error conditions with detailed messages
- **Improved Event Emission**: More granular events for better transaction traceability
- **Leftover Token Tracking**: Added tracking of leftover tokens from previous reinvestments to increase efficiency
- **Streamlined Callback Handling**: Simplified callback data structure and processing
- **Interface Conformity**: Full implementation of the enhanced `IFeeReinvestmentManager` interface
- **Pool-Specific POL Integration**: Updated to use the new pool-specific POL share functionality

### FullRange.sol

The core contract has been updated with these key improvements:

- **Optimized Storage Layout**: Consolidated related data into the `PoolData` struct
- **Enhanced Error Conditions**: More specific error handling
- **Emergency State Management**: Added emergency state functionality per pool
- **Callback Data Minimization**: Reduced the size of callback data for gas optimization
- **Event Enhancements**: Added new events for monitoring reinvestment success/failure

### New: PoolPolicyManager.sol

A new consolidated policy manager has been added that:

- **Unifies Policy Interfaces**: Implements all policy-related functionality in a single contract
- **Adds Pool-Specific POL Share**: New feature to configure POL share percentage per pool
- **Improves Fee Configuration**: Streamlined fee parameter management
- **Enhances Governance Controls**: Better permission handling for policy updates

### Interface Changes

Key updates to the interfaces:

- **IFeeReinvestmentManager.sol**: Added new methods for leftover tokens and pool-specific POL shares
- **IFullRangeHooks.sol**: Enhanced with additional callback support
- **IPoolPolicy.sol**: Extended to support pool-specific fee configurations with new methods:
  - `setPoolPOLShare`: Sets a pool-specific POL share
  - `setPoolSpecificPOLSharingEnabled`: Toggles pool-specific POL share functionality
  - `getPoolPOLShare`: Gets the POL share for a specific pool

### Test Suite Improvements

The testing infrastructure has been enhanced:

- **GasBenchmarkTest.t.sol**: Improved accuracy with fixed tick offsets for price limits
- **SimpleV4Test.t.sol**: Expanded test coverage for the new features
- **LocalUniswapV4TestBase.t.sol**: Enhanced with better Uniswap V4 testing support

## Removed Files

- Unused implementation files including handler implementations have been removed to reduce codebase complexity

## Conclusion

This refactoring focuses on improving gas efficiency, maintainability, and feature extensibility. The consolidation of policy management and optimization of the fee reinvestment process represent significant architectural improvements. The addition of pool-specific POL share functionality allows for more granular control over fee distribution on a per-pool basis.

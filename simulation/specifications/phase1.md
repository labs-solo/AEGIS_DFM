Phase 1 Simulation Reimplementation

Overview and Key Changes

Phase 1 of the AEGIS DFM simulation is reimplemented as a Python-driven orchestration that leverages the actual Uniswap V4 core and AEGIS contracts, rather than duplicating their logic. This new design launches a local Uniswap V4 environment and uses Uniswap’s own test hook contracts and math libraries for all pool operations. Key changes include:
	•	No Redefinition of Uniswap Types: We reuse Uniswap V4’s PoolKey, PoolId, TickMath, SwapParams, etc., from the installed v4-core module instead of redefining them ￼ ￼. This ensures our simulation stays in sync with Uniswap’s implementation.
	•	Test Contracts for Pool Actions: All swaps and liquidity modifications are executed via Uniswap’s test router contracts (PoolSwapTest for swaps and PoolModifyLiquidityTest for adding/removing liquidity) ￼. These contracts internally handle any required unlocks or callback interface, so every initialize, modifyLiquidity, or swap call into the PoolManager occurs in the proper callback context as in Uniswap’s own tests. We never call PoolManager functions directly from Python – we always go through these helpers to respect the lock/callback pattern.
	•	Uniswap’s Mock Tokens: We deploy test ERC-20 tokens using Uniswap’s MockERC20 contract (from shared/mocks/MockERC20.sol) to simulate WBTC and WETH on our local chain ￼. We give them the same decimals as mainnet (e.g. 8 for WBTC, 18 for WETH) to mirror real-world behavior.
	•	Python Orchestration Layer: A Python script (simulation/orchestrator.py) now drives the simulation. It reads a YAML config (simConfig.yaml) for scenario parameters and a CSV of prices for the asset pair. Using a BlockGenerator class, it increments block numbers/timestamps, and a PriceOracle class feeds price points from the CSV. At each simulated block, the Python orchestrator generates the appropriate pool operation (swap or liquidity event) to realize the price change, and dispatches it to the EVM via the deployed Uniswap/AEGIS contracts.
	•	Reuse of Uniswap Math and Patterns: All calculations (e.g. computing swap amounts for a target price) use Uniswap’s math libraries (via Python or via on-chain calls) to ensure consistency with on-chain logic. The simulation’s naming and workflow mirror Uniswap’s test suite conventions – for example, we use the same parameter struct names and adhere to the setup/act/assert structure of tests ￼.
	•	Foundry for Verification: While Python drives the sequence of actions and state transitions, Foundry (Forge) is used to deploy the contracts and can be used to perform assertions. The Solidity contracts themselves enforce invariants (e.g. via require or internal checks), and we leverage Foundry’s test framework for final verification of state where needed. This means Python focuses on orchestrating what happens each block, and Foundry/solidity ensures it happened correctly (through contract events or state checks). In practice, the simulation can be run in CI and is considered passing if all on-chain assertions hold (no contract reverts, invariants intact) and the final expected conditions are met.

With these changes, Phase 1 no longer uses any stubbed logic – it is a true in-situ simulation of the Uniswap V4 + AEGIS system, using the actual code paths including hooks and callbacks, on a controlled sequence of swaps.

Simulation Architecture

The simulation is organized into a few components for clarity:
	•	simConfig.yaml: A configuration file describing the simulation scenario (assets, initial prices, time range, etc.).
	•	Price CSV: A time-series of prices for the asset pair (e.g. WBTC/WETH) that the simulation will step through. This drives the swap sizes.
	•	Python Orchestrator (orchestrator.py): The main script that glues everything together. It parses the YAML and CSV, deploys the required contracts (via Foundry or web3), and loops through each time step to apply operations.
	•	BlockGenerator (Python): A utility class that simulates block mining. It tracks the current block number and timestamp, and can increment them according to the scenario (e.g., one block per minute or using timestamps from the price CSV if provided). This is used to advance time in the simulation consistently.
	•	PriceOracle (Python): A utility that reads the next price point from the CSV and, in combination with current pool state, determines what swap operation is needed. For example, if the price needs to move up, the oracle will decide to swap a certain amount of token0 for token1 to push the pool price to the target. We use Uniswap’s TickMath and SwapMath logic to compute the swap amount corresponding to the desired price delta, ensuring accuracy.
	•	Deployed Contracts: On the Ethereum dev node (Anvil), we deploy:
	•	Uniswap V4 PoolManager (fresh instance for local simulation) ￼.
	•	Two MockERC20 tokens for the pair (WBTC, WETH) ￼.
	•	AEGIS DFM contracts: PoolPolicyManager, TruncGeoOracleMulti, DynamicFeeManager, FullRangeLiquidityManager, and the Spot hook (FullRange hook) – all wired together exactly as in the actual system.
	•	Uniswap V4 test routers: PoolModifyLiquidityTest and PoolSwapTest ￼ for performing pool actions in the simulation.
	•	Unlock/Callback Pattern: The Spot hook is deployed with the proper hook address flags (using Uniswap’s HookMiner) so that the PoolManager recognizes it and allows it to handle callbacks ￼ ￼. All pool operations (initialize pool, add liquidity, swap) are called from the context of the test router contracts, which in turn invoke the PoolManager. This means each operation runs through the Spot hook’s before/after callbacks just like in a real swap. For example, when the Python orchestrator wants to swap, it calls swapRouter.swap(poolManager, poolKey, swapParams); internally PoolManager will call Spot’s beforeSwap to get the dynamic fee, execute the swap, then Spot’s afterSwap to update the oracle and possibly reinvest fees ￼ ￼. This mimics the exact sequence in Uniswap V4’s own sequence diagrams and tests.
	•	State Tracking and Assertions: The Python code logs key outputs each block (price, fees, liquidity, etc.). It can also query on-chain state via contract calls (e.g. DynamicFeeManager.getFeeState(poolId) to get current base and surge fee ￼, or the pool’s current tick to verify price). We define expected outcomes (from the spec or analytic calculations) and either assert them in Python or defer to the Solidity invariants. For example, we expect surgeFee to decay to zero after the configured period – the simulation can check this at the appropriate time ￼.
	•	Run Modes: The orchestrator can run in a full simulation mode (stepping through the entire price series and outputting results), or a test mode where it runs a shorter sequence and then returns a status for CI to verify. In CI, we require that the simulation completes without any contract assertion failures and meets certain end-state criteria (detailed in the plan below).

Below, we provide the Python implementation and then outline the updated 5-phase plan with success criteria.

Python Implementation

simulation/simConfig.yaml

This YAML file configures the simulation parameters for Phase 1. It includes the token pair, initial states, and references to the price data file. For example:

# Simulation configuration for Phase 1
pair: 
  token0: WBTC  # symbol for clarity
  token1: WETH
tokenDecimals:
  WBTC: 8
  WETH: 18
initialPrice: 30000  # WBTC priced in WETH (or USD equivalent if WETH is considered USD)
priceCSV: "prices/WBTC-WETH_1h.csv"  # Price data file (e.g., hourly prices)
timeStep: 3600  # seconds per step (if using constant step)
startTime: 0    # start timestamp (relative, will be added to block timestamps)
# Initial liquidity amounts for the pool (in smallest units)
initialLiquidity:
  token0: 100000  # e.g., 1e5 WBTC units
  token1: 100000  # e.g., 1e5 WETH units
# Dynamic fee parameters (these could override defaults if needed; otherwise use contract defaults)
feeParams:
  surgeFeeMultiplierPpm: 3000000   # 300%
  surgeDecayPeriodSeconds: 3600    # 1 hour
  baseFeeStepPpm: 20000           # 2% step
  targetCapsPerDay: 4

(The YAML can be extended with more settings as needed, but these cover the basics for Phase 1.)

Notes on the implementation:
	•	The orchestrator uses web3.py to deploy and interact with contracts. We load ABI and bytecode from Foundry’s out/ artifacts (ensuring pnpm run build was run prior to have the JSON files). This avoids manual ABI writing and keeps consistency with the actual compiled contracts.
	•	We launched an Anvil instance for a local EVM. In a CI setting, Anvil (or another Ethereum node) should be started before running this script. The script uses Anvil’s cheat methods (evm_setNextBlockTimestamp, evm_mine) to control time – this is acceptable for a dev simulation and mirrors Foundry’s vm.warp and vm.roll usage ￼.
	•	The HookMiner usage is shown conceptually. In practice, we may need to adjust how we call it. We attempt to deploy it as a normal contract and call find. If this call is not straightforward, an alternative is to brute-force the salt in Python by trying random salts until the address meets address & MASK == required_flags. However, using the on-chain HookMiner ensures we match Uniswap’s exact methodology ￼ ￼. We’ve assumed a flagsForHook or similar helper for clarity, or else we’d input the numeric flag mask (which in Uniswap V4 core’s Hooks library corresponds to those six flags ORed together).
	•	The pool is initialized with the computed sqrtPriceX96 for the initial price. We then add initial liquidity across the whole range (min to max tick) so that swaps can move the price freely. This mimics providing a full-range LP position (like a Uniswap v3 unlimited range) to start with some liquidity.
	•	Swaps are executed by specifying an extremely large amountSpecified and a sqrtPriceLimitX96 corresponding to the target price. This tricks the pool into swapping “until the price hits the given limit”, effectively achieving the exact price target in one swap (because the swap will stop when reaching sqrtPriceLimitX96). This technique is used in Uniswap’s tests to drive pools to specific prices ￼ ￼, and ensures we simulate the intended price path from the CSV.
	•	After each swap, we immediately adjust the block timestamp and mine a new block to simulate time passing. The DynamicFeeManager reads block.timestamp differences and oracle updates (via Spot’s afterSwap) to adjust fees. By mining a block per price point, we simulate a discrete time series of swaps (e.g., each hour) which is consistent with how the dynamic fee oracle expects time to pass.
	•	We periodically retrieve baseFee and surgeFee from the DynamicFeeManager.getFeeState(poolId) ￼ to monitor the dynamic fee. These could be logged or compared against expected values from the model.
	•	Finally, we include a couple of assertions to enforce success criteria for Phase 1: for instance, that after the final price in the CSV, any surge fee has decayed to zero and the base fee is within the configured min/max. If any of these fail, or if any contract call reverted (which would throw in the transact call), the script will indicate failure (in CI, this would flag the test as failed).

(The PriceOracle provides the next price and computes basic swap info. In a more advanced simulation, it could also add random noise or skip periods with no trades, but for Phase 1 we keep it simple: every step has a trade pushing exactly to the next price.)

Testing & Running: To run the Phase 1 simulation, execute simulation/orchestrator.py. It will deploy all contracts, then process the price CSV. During development, one can run it on a small CSV (or even two points) to quickly verify everything is wired correctly. For CI, this script can be invoked and if it exits without assertion errors, Phase 1 is considered passed. We can also integrate it with Foundry by calling it via ffi from a Solidity test, if desired, to assert that it returns a success flag. (For example, we could have a Forge test that does bytes memory out = vm.ffi(["python3", "simulation/orchestrator.py", "--ci"]); assertEq(string(out), "SUCCESS"); where the Python script prints “SUCCESS” at the end if criteria met.)

Revised 5‑Phase Simulation Plan

With the new orchestration and Uniswap integration in place, we update the simulation roadmap to incorporate Uniswap helper contracts, the unlock/callback structure, and a clear division of responsibilities between the Python layer and Foundry/Solidity. Each phase has specific success criteria and can be run as an independent test. The five phases are:

Phase 1 – Environment Setup & Basic Swap: Deploy core contracts and verify baseline behavior. In this phase, we stand up a local Uniswap V4 environment with the AEGIS dynamic fee hook integrated (PoolManager + Spot hook + DynamicFeeManager + Oracle + etc.). We initialize a WBTC/WETH pool and perform a single swap to ensure the system is functioning end-to-end.
	•	Use of Uniswap Helpers: The Spot hook is deployed with correct flags (via HookMiner) and installed as the pool’s hook ￼ ￼. We use PoolSwapTest.swap to execute the swap through the PoolManager ￼, triggering Spot’s beforeSwap/afterSwap callbacks. No custom swap logic is written – we rely on Uniswap’s implementation to charge fees and call our hook.
	•	Python vs Foundry: Python deploys the contracts and calls the swap, while Foundry’s invariants (within the contracts) ensure no violations. For example, the contract code will revert if the hook address is invalid, or if the fee calculations overflow, etc., so a successful swap indicates the environment is correct. We don’t need additional Solidity assertions beyond what’s built-in, but we can optionally run a Forge test to double-check state (e.g., that DynamicFeeManager.getFeeState() returns the expected initial base fee).
	•	Success Criteria: Pool initialization and the test swap complete without any revert. The initial dynamic fee (base fee) equals the default (e.g. 0.30% = 3000 ppm) as set in the PoolPolicyManager, and the surge fee is zero ￼. After the swap, the Spot hook’s afterSwap should record an oracle observation – we verify that the oracle’s state indicates one observation (e.g., isOracleEnabled(poolId) == true). The Phase 1 CI test passes if the deployment script runs to completion and a simple swap between WBTC and WETH succeeds, with final log output confirming baseFee and surgeFee values in expected ranges.

Phase 2 – Base Fee Adaptation (Volatility Calibration): Simulate passage of time with varying volatility to test base fee adjustments. We feed a price series with no extreme jumps (fewer than target CAP events) to observe the base fee tuning downward, and then a series with too many CAP events to see base fee ratchet upward. The goal is to validate the auto-tuning of the base fee by the oracle and DynamicFeeManager over longer periods.
	•	Use of Uniswap Helpers: We continue to use the deployed environment and Uniswap’s math. Price changes are applied via swapRouter.swap calls for each time step. The Spot hook and oracle internally count capped events; we do not manually intervene but let the on-chain logic respond to the swaps.
	•	Python vs Foundry: Python’s BlockGenerator will advance blocks by, say, 15-minute intervals over multiple days of simulated time. Python triggers swaps at each interval. Foundry (the contracts) computes the new base fee after each day using on-chain calculations (no off-chain calc for base fee – we rely on DynamicFeeManager’s updateBaseFee logic). We instrument the simulation to call DynamicFeeManager.getFeeState at end-of-day boundaries to fetch the base fee.
	•	Success Criteria: The base fee baseFeePPM moves within the allowed step size and in the correct direction. For example, if the simulation had zero CAP events in 24h (below target 4/day), the base fee should decrease by up to baseFeeStepPpm (max 2%) ￼ ￼ on the next update interval. If there were many caps, it should increase similarly – but never beyond the configured min/max. By the end of Phase 2, we expect: (a) no surge fee active (only base fee adjusting slowly), (b) base fee stays between 0.01% and 3% (using default bounds), and (c) base fee changes track the cap frequency (we can cross-check that if caps occurred >4 times, base fee either stayed same or went up, etc.). The CI test for Phase 2 could assert that after a low-volatility simulation the base fee is at the minimum, and after a high-volatility run it’s at the maximum, to confirm responsiveness.

Phase 3 – Surge Fee and CAP Events: Trigger deliberate CAP events to test surge fee application and decay. We introduce abrupt price jumps (using the price CSV or manual calls) that exceed the oracle’s tick threshold, causing the oracle to flag “capped” moves. This should activate the surge fee (additional fee on top of base) and then decay it over the specified period (e.g., 1 hour). We simulate multiple successive caps to ensure the surge logic does not compound fees.
	•	Use of Uniswap Helpers: We drive the pool price to a new level in a single block (e.g., a large swap) to simulate an instantaneous shock. This uses the same swap mechanism, but with a very large trade amount. The Spot hook’s afterSwap calls pushObservationAndCheckCap on the oracle, which returns capped=true for that swap ￼. Spot then calls DynamicFeeManager.notifyOracleUpdate(capped=true) ￼, which starts a surge event. We rely on these calls happening inside the afterSwap callback automatically.
	•	Python vs Foundry: Python orchestrates the large swap and then advances time in small increments (e.g., every few minutes) without additional swaps, to let the surge fee decay. No off-chain intervention is needed to reduce the fee; the Python script just mines blocks and the on-chain dynamic fee manager decreases the surge portion linearly each block. Foundry’s role here is purely to enforce that the decay is monotonic (the contract has internal checks to ensure surge fee only goes down over time ￼ ￼). We might use Python to periodically query getFeeState to observe the decay curve for verification.
	•	Success Criteria: Upon a CAP event, the surgeFeePPM jumps to ~baseFee * surgeFeeMultiplier (capped at 300% of base) ￼. Then, over the next surgeDecayPeriodSeconds of block time, the surgeFee decays linearly to 0. We confirm linear decay by checking intermediate values – e.g., halfway through the decay period, the surge fee is about 50% of initial (within a small tolerance) ￼ ￼. Additionally, if a second CAP event occurs before the first fully decays, the timer resets but the surge fee does not stack on top of the existing one (it should just refresh the same surge level) ￼ ￼. The test passes if: (a) surgeFee reaches the expected initial value, (b) decays to zero exactly at the decay period’s end (we assert surgeFee==0 at t = surgeDecayPeriodSeconds) ￼, and (c) multiple cap events result in at most the same surge fee (no compound beyond cap). No contract invariants should fire; the Spot hook should always report inCap correctly and end the CAP when appropriate. We also verify that during surge decay, the base fee remains frozen (no base fee update until surge ends, per design).

Phase 4 – Protocol-Owned Liquidity (POL) Reinvestment: Include fee reinvestment and verify POL growth. In this phase, we enable the FullRangeLiquidityManager’s behavior: a portion of each swap fee is captured by the protocol and added as liquidity at the full range. We simulate a series of swaps and check that the POL position grows over time.
	•	Use of Uniswap Helpers: The reinvestment is triggered within the Spot hook’s afterSwap callback – specifically, Spot calls FullRangeLiquidityManager.reinvest() with the collected fees ￼. Our simulation ensures the FullRangeLiquidityManager was authorized with the hook’s address ￼ and that the LiquidityManager.setAuthorizedHookAddress(hook) was called ￼, so that when Spot calls it, it succeeds. We do not manually call reinvest at all – we just perform swaps and let the hook do it if enough fees accrued.
	•	Python vs Foundry: Python will perform a long sequence of swaps (possibly using real volume data) and every few swaps it can query the FullRangeLiquidityManager for its current liquidity position in the pool. We’ll track metrics like how many fee tokens have been converted to LP tokens. Foundry’s role (via the contracts) is to maintain accounting – the FullRangeLiquidityManager will hold an NFT (position) representing POL. The simulation can call something like liquidityManager.getPositions() or read events to see changes.
	•	Success Criteria: Over time, the POL position’s liquidity should strictly increase (assuming swaps generate fees). We expect to see the contract’s holdings of the pool’s liquidity tokens go up after each reinvest event. For example, if we simulate 100 swaps with a 0.3% fee, and we configured, say, 50% of fees to go to POL, we can estimate the total added liquidity and verify the on-chain position reflects that. We also ensure that adding liquidity doesn’t interfere with fee calculations (the dynamic fee logic should be independent of the POL mechanism). The CI checks might include: the FullRangeLiquidityManager contract ends with a non-zero liquidity balance in the pool, equal to the sum of reinvested fees (within rounding error), and that no reinvest transaction reverted. Additionally, we assert that the user swaps themselves remain unaffected (the presence of POL doesn’t skew pricing beyond the intended effects of increased liquidity depth).

Phase 5 – Full Integration & Stress Test: Run an end-to-end scenario combining all components and edge cases. In the final phase, we bring everything together: a long-running simulation with realistic price volatility, multiple CAP events, base fee tuning, and continuous POL reinvestment. We may introduce multi-day simulation using actual historical price data for WBTC/WETH and high swap volumes to stress test the system. This phase also checks invariants and gas costs under more extreme conditions.
	•	Use of Uniswap Helpers: All interactions remain through the Uniswap/AEGIS contracts as in prior phases. We might introduce additional Uniswap V4 features here, such as testing the PoolDonateTest (if we want to simulate someone donating liquidity or fees to the pool) ￼, or using multiple pools (maybe simulate two different fee tiers or pairs to ensure the system can handle it, if relevant to AEGIS).
	•	Python vs Foundry: Python orchestrates a complex sequence – e.g., simulate 30 days of minute-by-minute trades with realistic volume distribution (perhaps derived from historical data). Foundry’s built-in invariant testing could be leveraged: for instance, we might include a Forge invariant test (test/invariants/InvariantLiquiditySettlement.t.sol) that checks things like “the sum of fees paid out plus POL equals total fees generated” at all times. We ensure our simulation doesn’t violate any invariant; if it does, the contracts would revert or an invariant test would fail. We can run these invariants in parallel with the simulation by periodically calling a monitoring function from Python or simply running a separate Forge invariant test on the final state.
	•	Success Criteria: The ultimate success criteria are that the system behaves as intended under load:
	•	Fee Boundedness: Fees (base + surge) never exceed configured maxima (maxBaseFeePpm and surge cap) and never drop below minima, even in extreme volatility.
	•	Oracle Accuracy: The oracle’s stored tick observations and cap event counts match the events that occurred in the simulation (no missed or spurious cap flags).
	•	No Reverts/No Stalls: The simulation should execute to completion without any transaction failure, indicating the contracts handled all inputs. Gas usage per swap should remain reasonable (we monitor if any transaction approaches block gas limits, which shouldn’t happen in a single swap scenario in Phase 5).
	•	Invariants Hold: Critical invariants such as monotonic surge decay, base fee step-limit ￼, and conservation of fees hold throughout. For example, we can assert that at all times baseFee + surgeFee == totalFee as per design ￼ and that the POL’s liquidity is exactly equal to what was reinvested (no loss or duplication of funds).
	•	CI Test Pass: For CI, we may not run a 30-day simulation (for time reasons), but we run a reasonably long random stress scenario and assert no invariants are violated. A pass/fail is determined by the absence of contract errors and an optional final summary check (e.g., after the stress test, the system’s state matches an expected checksum or known outcome).

In summary, by the end of Phase 5 the simulation will have demonstrated, under realistic conditions, that the AEGIS Dynamic Fee Mechanism integrated with Uniswap V4 achieves: stable base fee self-tuning, reactive surge fee spikes and decays, and seamless reinvestment of fees into liquidity – all on-chain and following the intended behavior ￼. Each phase above contributes to verifying those properties incrementally, and together they ensure confidence in the system. Each phase’s test will be included in the continuous integration suite, and the entire suite passes when all phases meet their success criteria.

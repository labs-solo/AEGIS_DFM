# FullRange Phase 7: Complete Multi-File Architecture Implementation

This PR completes the implementation of the FullRange hook for Uniswap V4, following the seven-phase development roadmap. The implementation uses a modular, multi-file architecture that significantly reduces code complexity while maintaining high test coverage.

## Architecture Overview

The FullRange implementation follows a modular design pattern with specialized components:

1. **Core Contract (`FullRange.sol`)**: 
   - Inherits from `ExtendedBaseHook` to implement Uniswap V4 hook interface
   - Delegates specialized functionality to submodules
   - Implements hook callbacks with custom logic for oracle updates and dynamic fee validation

2. **Pool Management (`FullRangePoolManager.sol`)**:
   - Handles pool creation with dynamic fee validation
   - Stores minimal pool data (totalLiquidity, tickSpacing)
   - Enforces governance controls for pool creation

3. **Liquidity Management (`FullRangeLiquidityManager.sol`)**:
   - Implements ratio-based deposit logic
   - Handles partial withdrawals with share token burning
   - Manages leftover tokens (remain in user wallet)

4. **Oracle Management (`FullRangeOracleManager.sol`)**:
   - Implements block/tick-based throttling for oracle updates
   - Tracks last update block and tick
   - Calls external oracle when thresholds are met

5. **Hook Callbacks (`FullRangeHooks.sol`)**:
   - Handles salt verification
   - Distinguishes deposit vs. withdrawal by liquidityDelta sign
   - Processes callback data

6. **Utility Functions (`FullRangeUtils.sol`)**:
   - Provides ratio math for deposits and withdrawals
   - Handles token transfers with allowance checks
   - Implements share calculation logic

7. **Interface Definition (`IFullRange.sol`)**:
   - Defines core data structures (DepositParams, WithdrawParams, etc.)
   - Specifies external interface for integrations

## File Structure

## Test Coverage

All core components have achieved the target of 90%+ test coverage:

- **FullRangeHooks.sol**: 100% line coverage
- **FullRangeLiquidityManager.sol**: 90.57% line coverage
- **FullRangeOracleManager.sol**: 97.06% line coverage
- **FullRangePoolManager.sol**: 95.65% line coverage
- **FullRangeUtils.sol**: 100% line coverage

The test suite includes:
- Unit tests for each component
- Integration tests for the complete system
- Edge case testing for ratio math, slippage, and oracle throttling
- Hook validation and callback testing

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Dynamic Fee Pool Creation**:
   - Only pools with dynamic fees (0x800000) are supported
   - Governance controls for pool creation

2. **Ratio-Based Deposits**:
   - Deposits use the optimal ratio of tokens
   - Leftover tokens remain in user wallet
   - Slippage protection with min amount parameters

3. **Partial Withdrawals**:
   - Burn share tokens for partial withdrawals
   - Proportional token return based on share percentage

4. **Oracle Throttling**:
   - Block-based throttling (skip updates if not enough blocks passed)
   - Tick-based throttling (skip updates if tick change is small)

5. **Hook Integration**:
   - Full implementation of Uniswap V4 hook interface
   - Custom logic in hook callbacks for oracle updates

## Integration Testing Plan

The following is a comprehensive plan for testing the FullRange implementation against a real PoolManager using Foundry's anvil:

```
# Simulation Steps (Using Anvil)

## 1. Install & Setup Foundry
- Install Foundry by running:
  ```
  curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
  foundryup
  ```
- Clone the repositories for your FullRange code (Phases 1–7) and the Uniswap V4‑core codebase.
- In your FullRange project folder, configure the foundry.toml or remappings.txt so it references your local Uniswap V4‑core path. Example:
  ```
  remappings = [
    "v4-core=../uniswap-v4-core",
    # possibly other remappings
  ]
  ```

## 2. Launch an Anvil Local Testnet
- Open a new terminal and run:
  ```
  anvil --block-time 1
  ```
  This spins up a local Ethereum environment with instant blocks or ~1s blocks, ideal for testing.

## 3. Deploy a Real PoolManager from Uniswap V4‑Core to Anvil
- In your FullRange repo, create a deployment script (e.g., a Foundry "script" or a Hardhat plugin if you prefer bridging).
- Compile the v4‑core code with Foundry:
  ```
  forge build
  ```
- Deploy the PoolManager contract to your local anvil:
  ```
  forge create --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545 path/to/PoolManager.sol:PoolManager --private-key <YOUR_TEST_KEY>
  ```
- This yields a deployed address for your PoolManager. Note it for the next step.

## 4. Deploy Submodules (PoolManager, LiquidityManager, OracleManager) against Anvil
- FullRangePoolManager:
  ```
  forge create --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545 ./src/FullRangePoolManager.sol:FullRangePoolManager \
    --constructor-args <DeployedPoolManagerAddress> <GovernanceAddress> \
    --private-key <YOUR_TEST_KEY>
  ```
- FullRangeLiquidityManager:
  ```
  forge create --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545 ./src/FullRangeLiquidityManager.sol:FullRangeLiquidityManager \
    --constructor-args <DeployedPoolManagerAddress> <DeployedFullRangePoolManagerAddress> \
    --private-key <YOUR_TEST_KEY>
  ```
- FullRangeOracleManager:
  ```
  forge create --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545 ./src/FullRangeOracleManager.sol:FullRangeOracleManager \
    --constructor-args <DeployedPoolManagerAddress> <TruncGeoOracleAddress> \
    --private-key <YOUR_TEST_KEY>
  ```
- No direct deploy for FullRangeUtils if it's a library. Foundry will link it automatically.

## 5. Deploy the Final FullRange.sol Hook
- Reference the addresses from the submodules (PoolManager, LiquidityManager, OracleManager) and pass them to FullRange:
  ```
  forge create --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545 ./src/FullRange.sol:FullRange \
    --constructor-args <AnvilDeployedPoolManagerAddress> \
                      <DeployedFullRangePoolManagerAddress> \
                      <DeployedFullRangeLiquidityManagerAddress> \
                      <DeployedFullRangeOracleManagerAddress> \
                      <GovernanceAddress> \
    --private-key <YOUR_TEST_KEY>
  ```
- ExtendedBaseHook constructor is invoked, verifying that the deployed hook's permissions match your getHookPermissions() logic (via Hooks.validateHookPermissions).

## 6. Register the FullRange Address as a Hook in the Real PoolManager
- For any new pool you create, set the hooks field in the PoolKey to the deployed FullRange address.
- Example if you do it manually:
  ```
  PoolKey memory key = PoolKey({
    currency0: token0,
    currency1: token1,
    fee: 0x800000, // dynamic fee
    tickSpacing: 60,
    hooks: <FullRangeHookAddress>
  });
  // Then manager.initialize(key, initialSqrtPriceX96) or createPool(key, initialSqrtPriceX96)
  ```

## 7. Simulate Dynamic‑Fee Pool Creation
- Impersonate or use the governance key you used above:
  ```
  anvil --block-time 1 --accounts 10 # note that one account is your gov
  ```
- Call initializeNewPool(...) on FullRange:
  ```
  fullRange.initializeNewPool(key, initialSqrtPriceX96);
  ```
- Confirm the call references FullRangePoolManager internally, and the real Uniswap PoolManager is invoked.
- Verify if a non‑dynamic fee is used → revert with "NotDynamicFee".

## 8. Simulate a Deposit
- Approve tokens on the local anvil environment:
  1. Deploy or mint an ERC20 token to your test account.
  2. ERC20(token0).approve(address(FullRange), hugeAmount)
  3. Same for token1.
- Deposit:
  ```
  fullRange.deposit({
    poolId: pid,
    amount0Desired: ...,
    amount1Desired: ...,
    amount0Min: ...,
    amount1Min: ...,
    to: ...,
    deadline: ...
  });
  ```
- Confirm leftover tokens remain in your wallet if ratio is not fully used.
- Observe the on-chain events from hooking logic (beforeAddLiquidity, afterAddLiquidity) if you track them in your local anvil logs.

## 9. Simulate a Partial Withdrawal
- If you minted shares for deposit, you can burn some for partial withdrawal:
  ```
  fullRange.withdraw({
    poolId: pid,
    sharesBurn: 500,
    amount0Min: ...,
    amount1Min: ...,
    deadline: ...
  });
  ```
- Confirm partial ratio logic, check hooking calls like beforeRemoveLiquidity, afterRemoveLiquidity.

## 10. Hooks Callback Verification
- Perform a swap via the real PoolManager referencing this FullRange address as hooks.
- Anvil logs or Foundry traces will show calls to beforeSwap / afterSwap.
- If you have a custom logic in _beforeSwap, you can check the returned BeforeSwapDelta.

## 11. Invoke Oracle Updates
- Call:
  ```
  fullRange.updateOracle(key);
  ```
- Confirm anvil logs the calls to FullRangeOracleManager.updateOracleWithThrottle, and if block/tick thresholds are not met, no external oracle call is made.

## 12. Claim & Reinvest Fees
- Generate some volume or simulate fees.
- Call:
  ```
  fullRange.claimAndReinvestFees();
  ```
- Confirm FullRangeLiquidityManager logic is invoked.
- Observe minted or re-staked liquidity if that's how you coded your submodules.

## 13. Coverage Check
- In a separate environment, run Foundry coverage:
  ```
  forge coverage
  ```
- This ensures you see 90%+ coverage. Verify the final FullRange.sol lines/branches are tested. You may want to add or tweak tests in your Foundry test folder if coverage is below 90.

## 14. Optional Final Trials
- Try large token amounts and partial leftover to ensure no overflow.
- Try forced or custom hooking to see how your _beforeSwap or _beforeInitialize logic might respond to unusual data.

## 15. Prepare for Audit
- Provide this anvil simulation script & instructions, along with your final code, to the auditors.
- Summarize design decisions (dynamic fee, leftover tokens, hooking approach, fallback logic, block/tick threshold, etc.) for clear audit scoping.
```

## Next Steps

We request that Taylor proceed with the Anvil-based integration testing as specified in the plan above. This will ensure that our implementation works correctly with a real Uniswap V4 PoolManager in a close-to-production environment.

The integration testing will validate:
1. Hook address validation and permissions
2. Dynamic fee pool creation
3. Deposit and withdrawal functionality
4. Oracle throttling logic
5. Hook callback behavior

Once the integration testing is complete, we'll be ready for a formal audit of the codebase.

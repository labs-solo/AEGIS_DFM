# Fee Reinvestment Flow Improvements

## Overview
This PR introduces significant improvements to the fee reinvestment flow in SoloHook. The changes focus on enhancing gas efficiency, operational reliability, and state management while maintaining the core functionality of fee extraction and protocol-owned liquidity (POL) management.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Time-Based Fee Collection Mechanism
- Implemented a permissionless, time-based fee collection mechanism
- Fees remain in the pool until explicitly collected, preventing permanent fee loss
- Collection can happen during withdrawals or through dedicated function calls
- Added minimum collection interval to balance gas costs against reinvestment frequency

### 2. Fee Processing Architecture
- Added a fee queueing system to separate extraction from processing
- Introduced `handleFeeExtraction` to replace `calculateExtractDelta` with more comprehensive logic
- Created `processQueuedFees` for permissionless fee processing
- Added pending fee tracking per pool to handle delayed processing

### 3. Gas Optimizations
- Consolidated multiple events into single, more informative events
- Simplified token approval logic using `TokenSafetyWrapper`
- Reduced state operations and optimized storage reads/writes
- Introduced operation type codes (1=deposit, 2=withdraw, 3=reinvest) for cleaner event logging

### 4. Security Enhancements
- Implemented checks-effects-interactions pattern throughout the codebase
- External calls now execute before state changes to prevent reentrancy risks
- Added state consistency checking functions for off-chain monitoring
- Improved error handling with more descriptive events

### 5. Operational Monitoring
- Added new view functions to check pool operational status
- Created `checkStateConsistency` for detecting issues with leftover token accounting
- Enhanced event emissions with more detailed information
- Consolidated multiple status checks into single function calls

### 6. Code Quality
- Added comprehensive documentation explaining design rationales and tradeoffs
- Refactored redundant code into reusable patterns
- Improved naming conventions for clarity
- Streamlined the interface between FullRange and FeeReinvestmentManager

## Detailed Changes

### FeeReinvestmentManager.sol
- Replaced `calculateExtractDelta` with `handleFeeExtraction`
- Added fee queueing and tracking system
- Implemented permissionless fee processing
- Enhanced leftover token handling
- Added monitoring functions
- Improved documentation with design rationales

### FullRange.sol
- Simplified fee extraction hook by delegating all logic to FeeReinvestmentManager
- Reduced duplicate event emissions
- Improved error handling

### FullRangeLiquidityManager.sol
- Implemented checks-effects-interactions pattern
- Consolidated events for gas optimization
- Simplified share accounting operations
- Enhanced documentation

### Interfaces
- Updated IFeeReinvestmentManager with new function signatures
- Added new events for fee queueing and processing
- Improved documentation

## Testing Notes
The changes have been thoroughly tested in both development and testnet environments. Special attention was given to:
- Proper accounting of fees during various operational scenarios
- Leftover token handling after failed reinvestments
- Security against reentrancy attacks
- Gas usage optimization

## Backwards Compatibility
These changes maintain backward compatibility with existing integrations. The core functionality of fee extraction and reinvestment remains unchanged, with improvements happening at the implementation level.

## Code Refactoring for Fee Reinvestment Functions

In commit [18d7345](https://github.com/labs-solo/SoloHook/commit/18d7345d3596d17132280354014c8631cd11657e), I addressed several code optimization issues:

### 1. Eliminated Unused Parameters
- Removed unused `fullRangeAmount0` and `fullRangeAmount1` parameters from `reinvestFees` in `FullRangeLiquidityManager.sol`
- Updated function calls to match the new signature

### 2. Consolidated Duplicated Functions
- Combined the two duplicate `processReinvestmentIfNeeded` functions in `FeeReinvestmentManager.sol` into one consistent implementation
- Simplified the interface by removing redundant overloads

### 3. Improved Documentation
- Added clarifying comments to explain the relationship between `collectAccumulatedFees` and `reinvestFees`
- Updated parameter descriptions to better reflect their purpose

### 4. Interface Consistency
- Updated all relevant interfaces to maintain consistency with the implementation
- Ensured parameter names and return value descriptions match the implementation

These changes improve code maintainability and readability while keeping the same functionality.
